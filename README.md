GunnerStats is a high-fidelity football statistics dashboard designed for Arsenal fans to track player performance, match results, and league standings. This project serves as a sophisticated UI/UX prototype, demonstrating advanced frontend architecture and responsive dashboard design.

**[Live Preview](https://yuzstack-gunner-stats.netlify.app/)**

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend Library:** React.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Design Workflow:** Magic Patterns to Figma (Custom UI Architecture)

## ⚠️ Project Status: Paused (Data Layer Hurdle)

Currently, this project is a **Functional UI Prototype.** Development has been strategically paused at the integration stage.

**The Challenge:** During the transition from static UI to live data, I encountered a significant hurdle: the lack of a comprehensive, free-tier Sports API that provides the granular player statistics required for this specific dashboard. As an engineer, I chose to pause rather than compromise the "vision" of the app with substandard data.

## 🧠 What’s Implemented (The Wins)

- **Responsive Dashboard Architecture:** Built a complex, multi-grid layout that remains fluid across all screen sizes.
- **Mobile-First Navigation:** Implemented a custom dropdown navigation system specifically optimized for small-screen interactions.
- **Component Composition:** Created a library of reusable "Stat Cards" and "Data Tables" designed to ingest JSON data.
- **Design Fidelity:** Successfully translated a high-level Figma concept into a pixel-perfect, interactive React application using Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Getting Started
